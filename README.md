# Inditex Assessment

## Overview

This project is part of the technical assessment for Inditex. It is a React application built with Vite and TypeScript.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pmsg21/inditex-tech-test.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```

## Running the Application

### Development Mode

To run the application in development mode, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. The application will be served with assets in an unminified state, suitable for development and debugging purposes.

### Production Mode

To build and run the application in production mode, execute the following commands:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The `build` script compiles the TypeScript code and optimizes the assets for production, including concatenating and minifying files. The `preview` script serves the built application from the `dist` directory on a local server. Open the provided URL in your web browser to view the application.

## Conclusion

You can now run the Inditex Assessment project in both development and production modes. Happy coding!
